                <h3>Morning routine</h3>
                  Its important to have a morning routine that includes a spesific time to wake up every morning, and an overall plan on how to start your day.
                  You can include skincare into this step, and create your own skincare routine based in your own needs.
                  So start of your mornings a little extra early, maybe around 7 am or 8 am, so that you get more time to get ready and a little bit more "me time".
                  Next step, hop into the shower and then proceed with your, now newly created, skincare routine. Skincare might be your next step after taking a shower,
                  but remember too get dressed. To make the morning less stressful and easer pick out todays outfit the night before. Your mornings will go extra
                  smoothly when you already have everything is already planned out ahead of time.

                <h3>Food</h3>
                  After getting ready its time for the most important meal of the day, your brekafast. Because breakfast is your first meal of the day, and the most
                  important meal, it is important to eat healthy and well. The food you will eat at now will help you have energy for the rest of the until your next meal
                  so it is important to have something good and healthy. Examples of meals are oatmeals with berries, og maybe a smoothie bowl or just a tasty fruity smoothie
                  along with a bagel. You can even make some of these meals the day before to save some extra time!

                <h3>Plan your day</h3>
                  While having your breakfast you should put your phone away and focus more on yourself than other peoples social media sites. Use this time to plan
                  the rest of your day. You can use a daily planer and write down all of the plans for the day, or maybe even start a bullet journal where you can
                  have a little more fun with planing your day, as well as bring some creativity into your everyday life, maybe even start a drawing in the morning
                  that you can work on completing through out the day. And now that your done with your morning, it's time to head out!

                <h3>Food</h3>
                  Right now you are maybe at work or at school, or just at home, but now its time for the second
                  meal of the day. If you're at work or at school, maybe a homemade lunch is the right way to go?
                  Bringing your own meal will save you money, and you will also get to eat whatever you want exactly
                  the way you like it. As well as the meal is important, it's also important to stay hydrated so
                  remember to drink a lot of watter through out the day!<br>
                  But yout might not be at school or work, and you're staying at home. So use this time to create a
                  good lunch, and get some work done. Use the afternoon to study or get work done, and listen to som good
                  music to fit the vibe, as well as making yourself a good meal!
                <h3>Plan your day</h3>
                  Your started planing your day during your breakfast, so now its time to organise your plan by
                  removing the things you've done, and maybe add some new plans you've made. As well as planing your day
                  maybe you can continue on the drawing yout started this morning. But you dont have to spend this meal
                  all alone, try to socialise with your co-workers or fellow students.

                  <h3>Get active!</h3>
                    You're finally home and it's time to relax after your long day, but before that why not try
                    to include a little workout. Even if your tired after your day outside, try to take a minute
                    to relax and then try to get a little active. It will make falling asleep early very easy
                    and your will feel so good after.
                  <h3>Food</h3>
                    After this workout try not to have a very heavy dinner, and try to get something healthy.
                    Maybe crate one of the meals you can find on one of these videoes.
                  <h3>End the day</h3>
                    Now you've had a long day, included your workout, and it's time to relax. Get in the shower
                    to get clean after your workout, and as well as you created a morning routine, create a night
                    routine as well. Get a good skincare routine and just relax. But before getting into bed, try
                    to make your next morning easier, try to pick out for outfir or try to make your brekafast.
                    <br>
                    But now that you're in bed and your getting ready to sleep, take a minute to reflect over your day.
                    Pick up your daily planer, or your bullet journal and note down all you've done today. Write down
                    how you've felt and how you are feeling right now. And if you havent finished the artwork your started
                    this morning, maybe try to finish that tonight. And now, it's time to get some sleep and relax
                    before another busy day.
